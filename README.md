## Warning!

This tool is changing Windows Registry of your operating systems to maintain dark mode module. Generally, editing Windows Registry is not suggested. You should not use that tool if you do not know what you are doing. Because the guy who is prepared this page and rest of things, also does not know everything about Windows Registry. And the guy does not want to take any responsibility about any possible issue. There is no any test on any devices except the guy's.

## Invitation

If you are know anything about command line/batch programming, or windows registry, do not hesitate to contribute, please.
